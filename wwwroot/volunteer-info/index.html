							<h2>Why Volunteer to Teach?</h2>
							<p>People choose to volunteer for a variety of reasons. Volunteering offers you the chance to give something back to a community or make a difference to the people around you. Volunteering provides an opportunity to develop new skills, build on experience and use your knowledge to benefit others. Regardless of why you choose volunteer teaching you will gain as much from the experience as the children you teach. </p>
							<p>In South Africa, research has shown that quality protection, stimulation and learning opportunities provided at home by parents and caregivers or through Early Childhood Development Centres have a positive and long-lasting impact on a young child's ability to develop its full potential.</p>
							<p>In the Global Competitiveness Report (2015 – 2016) South Africa ranked 138th out of 140 countries for the quality of its education system. Challenges facing the Early Childhood Development sector include funding, training and capacity. </p>
							<p>By volunteering to teach with Leap4Change, you help the children to learn, grow and give them the tools they need to make the most of their education.</p>

					<h2>Where Will I Volunteer?</h2>
					<div class="q-columns-6">
						<p>All of our projects are situated in areas across the Western Cape where the greatest need is. You will be working mostly in disadvantaged communities, including informal settlements around Cape Town and rural farming communities in the Western Cape.</p>
						<p>Some of the projects are simple day care facilities run in someone's home where the focus is on  keeping the children safe rather than teaching them while their parents are at work. These centres are often run by Carers who are not trained in Early Childhood Development, so during this critical time of brain development children do not receive the foundation that they need to succeed in school.</p>
						<p>Parents often work up to sixteen hours a day while their children are very young. In areas where no day care facilities are available, and there are no caretakers during the day to enrich the children’s days with activities and games, children are put into school too early, so their parents can work to provide for them. This means that children are not developmentally ready and start their schooling way behind their peers.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="q-columns-6">
						<p>Overcrowding in classrooms often means that children fall further behind without their teachers’ knowledge. As a result these children struggle and do not develop a love for learning, which contributes to the high dropout rate in South Africa.</p>
						<p>By working in these situations you will have the opportunity to help children develop the essential skills and the ability to learn that they would otherwise miss out on. You will be helping young minds to unlock their potential.</p>

					<h2>How does it work?</h2>
					<div class="q-columns-6">
						<p>As a potential volunteer you need to complete an application form. Once we receive your application we will confirm if we have space available or suggest alternative dates. If you are unsure if this programme is for you, you can send us a contact request and we will get in touch to assess if this is the right programme for you.</p>
						<p>If your application is successful Leap4Change will phone you for an interview and discuss the possible projects that match your skills and interests during the period you have available.</p>
						<p>When we have your perfect match, we will send you a confirmation to accept. If you choose to join the project you will need to pay a deposit to confirm your spot and the full fees are due 8 weeks before arrival.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="q-columns-6">
						<p>Project durations are a minimum of 6 weeks, but to make a real difference we recommend a commitment of 3 months. The children become very attached to their volunteer teachers, and staying for longer means playing a greater part in their lives and their education.</p>
						<p>At the end of your stay you will receive a certificate of completion, and may request a reference letter.</p>

					<h2>Volunteer Training</h2>
					<div class="q-columns-6">
						<p>Training and orientation is scheduled for the first week after your arrival. During these training sessions we will cover everything you need to know about the education programme, how to use the materials and games, and what will be expected of you at your project. </p>
						<p>The training is fun and interactive, and  everyone has a chance to teach and experience the programme from the child's perspective. The training is non-academic and you do not need to have any previous experience, only an outgoing personality, willingness to learn and a passion for making a difference.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="q-columns-6">
						<p>We are here for you every step of the way to help and guide you. You receive full ongoing training and support, so that together we ensure that each child receives the gift of education.</p>

					<h2>Why do you pay?</h2>
					<div class="q-columns-12">
						<p>It is important that you realise you are not paying to volunteer. Your fees go toward providing you with comfortable accommodation, full in country support, training, materials and to cover daily operational costs. Each and every volunteer enables us to supply our centres with the toys and material they need to run the programme and every child with their own) learner pack.</p>
						<p>We do not receive any funding and our project relies solely on volunteer participation. Without you we would not be able to implement our programme and our children would not receive this gift of education.</p>

					<h2>What will you be doing?</h2>
					<div class="q-columns-12">
						<p>As a volunteer teacher you will be presenting the booster programme to children between the ages of 1 - 7 years. Homework assistance especially English and Mathematics could mean you move between classes during the course of the day. Drama lessons and sport are an integral part of development which you will participate in. You might also assist children in higher grades to use technology (computers) for project research. You will also be involved in the day to day schooling or child care, helping to supervise children during formal classes and lunch times, assisting with food preparation. This is tiring work, but it is incredibly rewarding.</p>
