				<p><strong>LEAP4Change believes success is easier when children can make the most of their education, and making the most of their education is easier when they've developed basic skills and knowledge.</strong></p>
				<p>Most people take these basic tools for granted, but when there are very little resources this solid foundation is hard to acquire. We want you to help us make this privilege the right that it should be. Our vision is to ensure every child is equipped with the building blocks to help them succeed in education, sport and life.</p>
				<p>Our team and partners have more than 40 years of combined experience, and we can equip you to be able to make a real difference and contribution to the future and to those around you.</p>
				<p>If we all work together, we can really <strong>LEAP4Change</strong>.</p>
